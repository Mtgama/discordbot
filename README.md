# Discord Assistanse

### description: Discord's robotic assistant to control your system remotely. With this robot, you can use commands such as:

- System camera control
- Screen control - screenshot and screen record
- Control the keyboard keys
- Windows command line control
- Using artificial intelligence to detect intruders with a camera
- Surround sound recording
- Increase and decrease the volume along with the alarm
- Control the status of the mouse and send a report to the robot in case of system manipulation
- etc...

1. Log in to the Discord website and obtain a token. 
2. Then, run the discordbot.py file and enter your token there. Once connected, your bot will be active on Discord, and you can receive the bot's active commands by sending the word "help."
3. **An unfiltered internet connection is required!**
If the connection is successful, the connection icon will change from red to green.
If you want to convert the program to an exe file, use the setup.py file:
- First, install the cx_Freeze library with the pip command: 
    ```sh
    pip install cx_Freeze
    ```
- Then, in the program directory, call cmd and run the command ```python python setup.py build ``` and wait for the exe file to be created
